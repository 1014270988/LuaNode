* Export ESP32 toolchains by running the following command in Linux terminal, 
  `export PATH=/your_path/toolchains/esp32/bin:$PATH`

* Export `IDF_PATH` by running the command, `export IDF_PATH=/your_path/LuaNode/LuaNode_Esp32/esp-idf/`,
  where `your_path` is the path your save LuaNode.

* Change directory to `LuaNode32`, and then compile the project, `make`

# FIRMWARE

The firmware we built in the firmware directory is for test. You can flash it 
to your device to test LuaNode.
