config NEWLIB_STDOUT_ADDCR
	bool "Standard-out output adds carriage return before newline"
	default y
	help
		Most people are used to end their printf strings with a newline. If this
		is sent as is to the serial port, most terminal programs will only move the
		cursor one line down, not also move it to the beginning of the line. This
		is usually done by an added CR character. Enabling this will make the
		standard output code automatically add a CR character before a LF.
